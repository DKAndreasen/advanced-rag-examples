    "# Chunk optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "I order to abide by a the context window of LLMs, documents are usually split into smaller parts when creating RAG pipelines. This is called chunking. While chunking comes with the added benefits of reducing costs and noise in the *generation* step, it also introduces a new problem: \"How do we prevent losing important information when splitting the document into chunks?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In baseline RAG, we usually split the document into chunks of fixed size including a fixed overlap between adjacent chunks. In most common cases this practice works well and it is computationally efficient and does not require any NLP models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the problem of chunk optimization by exploring a few different strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fixed size chunking**: Split the document into chunks of fixed size.\n",
    "2. **Semantic chunking**: Considers the semantic meaning behind the text and divides the document into meaningful semantic chunks\n",
    "3. **Hyperparameter tuning**: Traditional ML via grid-search\n",
    "\n",
    "Other strategies include\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Specific Chunking**: Split the document based on the logical sections of the document. Useful for Markdown, HTML, etc.\n",
    "2. **Recursive Chunking**: Recursive chunking divides the input text into smaller chunks in a hierarchical and iterative manner using a set of separators. If the initial attempt at splitting the text doesn’t produce chunks of the desired size or structure, the method recursively calls itself on the resulting chunks with a different separator or criterion until the desired chunk size or structure is achieved. \n",
    "3. **Agentic Chunk**: Use LLMs as \"agents\" and split the document into chunks in the fasion a human would do - start at the top and continue down the document while deciding whether to start a new chunk given the current sentence. \n"

      "Vincent van Gogh\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Vincent Willem van Gogh (Dutch: [ˈvɪnsɛnt ˈʋɪləɱ‿vɑŋ‿ˈɣɔx] ; 30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade, he created approximately 2100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. His oeuvre includes landscapes, still lifes, portraits, and self-portraits, most of which are characterized by bold colors and dramatic brushwork that contributed to the rise of expressionism in modern art. Van Gogh's work was beginning to gain critical attention before he died at age 37, by what was suspected at the time to be a suicide. During his lifetime, only one of Van Gogh's paintings, The Red Vineyard, was sold. \n",
      "Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and was serious, quiet and thoughtful, but showed signs of mental instability. As a young man, he worked as an art dealer, often travelling, but became depressed after he was transferred to London. He turned to religion and spent time as a missionary in southern Belgium. Later he drifted into ill-health and solitude. He was keenly aware of modernist trends in art and, while back with his parents, took up painting in 1881. His younger brother, Theo, supported him financially, and the two of them maintained a long correspondence.\n",
      "Van Gogh's early works consist of mostly still lifes and depictions of peasant laborers. In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members of the artistic avant-garde, including Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin, who were seeking new paths beyond Impressionism. Frustrated in Paris and inspired by a growing spirit of artistic change and collaboration, in February 1888, Van Gogh moved to Arles in southern France to establish an artistic retreat and commune. Once there, Van Gogh's art changed.\n",
      "---------------------------\n",
      "Once there, Van Gogh's art changed. His paintings grew brighter and he turned his attention to the natural world, depicting local olive groves, wheat fields and sunflowers. Van Gogh invited Gauguin to join him in Arles and eagerly anticipated Gauguin's arrival in the fall of 1888.\n",
      "Van Gogh suffered from psychotic episodes and delusions. Though he worried about his mental stability, he often neglected his physical health, did not eat properly and drank heavily. His friendship with Gauguin ended after a confrontation with a razor when, in a rage, he severed his left ear. Van Gogh spent time in psychiatric hospitals, including a period at Saint-Rémy. After he discharged himself and moved to the Auberge Ravoux in Auvers-sur-Oise near Paris, he came under the care of the homeopathic doctor Paul Gachet. His depression persisted, and on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh is believed to have shot himself in the chest with a revolver, dying from his injuries two days later.\n",
      "Van Gogh's work began to attract critical artistic attention in the last year of his life. After his death, Van Gogh's art and life story captured public imagination as an emblem of misunderstood genius, due in large part to the efforts of his widowed sister-in-law Johanna van Gogh-Bonger. His bold use of color, expressive line and thick application of paint inspired avant-garde artistic groups like the Fauves and German Expressionists in the early 20th century. Van Gogh's work gained widespread critical and commercial success in the following decades, and he has become a lasting icon of the romantic ideal of the tortured artist. Today, Van Gogh's works are among the world's most expensive paintings ever sold. His legacy is honored and celebrated by the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, which holds the world's largest collection of his paintings and drawings.\n",
      "---------------------------\n",
      "Letters\n",
      "\n",
      "The most comprehensive primary source on Van Gogh is his correspondence with his younger brother, Theo. Their lifelong friendship, and most of what is known of Vincent's thoughts and theories of art, are recorded in the hundreds of letters they exchanged from 1872 until 1890. Theo van Gogh was an art dealer and provided his brother with financial and emotional support as well as access to influential people on the contemporary art scene.\n",
      "Theo kept all of Vincent's letters to him; but Vincent kept only a few of the letters he received. After both had died, Theo's widow Jo Bonger-van Gogh arranged for the publication of some of their letters. A few appeared in 1906 and 1913; the majority were published in 1914. Vincent's letters are eloquent and expressive, have been described as having a \"diary-like intimacy\", and read in parts like autobiography. Translator Arnold Pomerans wrote that their publication adds a \"fresh dimension to the understanding of Van Gogh's artistic achievement, an understanding granted to us by virtually no other painter\".\n",
      "\n",
      "There are more than 600 letters from Vincent to Theo and around 40 from Theo to Vincent. There are 22 to his sister Wil, 58 to the painter Anthon van Rappard, 22 to Émile Bernard as well as individual letters to Paul Signac, Paul Gauguin, and the critic Albert Aurier. Some are illustrated with sketches. Many are undated, but art historians have been able to place most in chronological order. Problems in transcription and dating remain, mainly with those posted from Arles. While there, Vincent wrote around 200 letters in Dutch, French, and English. There is a gap in the record when he lived in Paris as the brothers lived together and had no need to correspond.\n",
      "The highly paid contemporary artist Jules Breton was frequently mentioned in Vincent's letters. In 1875 letters to Theo, Vincent mentions he saw Breton, discusses the Breton paintings he saw at a Salon, and discusses sending one of Breton's books but only on the condition that it be returned. In a March 1884 letter to Rappard he discusses one of Breton's poems that had inspired one of his paintings.\n"

      "Early years\n",
      "\n",
      "Vincent Willem van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 in Groot-Zundert, in the predominantly Catholic province of North Brabant in the Netherlands. He was the oldest surviving child of Theodorus van Gogh (1822–1885), a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, and his wife, Anna Cornelia Carbentus (1819–1907). Van Gogh was given the name of his grandfather and of a brother stillborn exactly a year before his birth. Vincent was a common name in the Van Gogh family. The name had been borne by his grandfather, the prominent art dealer Vincent (1789–1874), and a theology graduate at the University of Leiden in 1811. This Vincent had six sons, three of whom became art dealers, and may have been named after his great-uncle, a sculptor (1729–1802).\n",
      "Van Gogh's mother came from a prosperous family in The Hague. His father was the youngest son of a minister. The two met when Anna's younger sister, Cornelia, married Theodorus's older brother Vincent (Cent). Van Gogh's parents married in May 1851 and moved to Zundert. His brother Theo was born on 1 May 1857. There was another brother, Cor, and three sisters: Elisabeth, Anna, and Willemina (known as \"Wil\"). In later life, Van Gogh remained in touch only with Willemina and Theo. Theodorus's salary as a minister was modest, but the Church also supplied the family with a house, a maid, two cooks, a gardener, a carriage and horse; his mother Anna instilled in the children a duty to uphold the family's high social position.\n",
      "Van Gogh was a serious and thoughtful child. He was taught at home by his mother and a governess, and in 1860, was sent to the village school. In 1864, he was placed in a boarding school at Zevenbergen, where he felt abandoned, and he campaigned to come home. Instead, in 1866, his parents sent him to the middle school in Tilburg, where he was also deeply unhappy. His interest in art began at a young age. He was encouraged to draw as a child by his mother, and his early drawings are expressive, but do not approach the intensity of his later work. Constant Cornelis Huijsmans, who had been a successful artist in Paris, taught the students at Tilburg. His philosophy was to reject technique in favour of capturing the impressions of things, particularly nature or common objects. Van Gogh's profound unhappiness seems to have overshadowed the lessons, which had little effect. In March 1868, he abruptly returned home. \n"

      "From an early age, Vincent was serious and thoughtful. He was initially educated at home by his mother and a governess before attending the village school in 1860. He later went to a boarding school in Zevenbergen in 1864, which he found distressing enough to campaign for his return home. In 1866, he was sent to a middle school in Tilburg, where he also experienced deep unhappiness. Throughout his early years, Vincent showed signs of the mental instability that would affect him throughout his life.\n"

      "Vincent Willem van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853, in Groot-Zundert, Netherlands, to Theodorus van Gogh, a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, and Anna Cornelia Carbentus. He was the oldest surviving child in a family that included his brother Theo and three sisters. Vincent was named after his grandfather and a stillborn brother. His early education was conducted at home and later at boarding schools, which he found unhappy. Despite this, his interest in art began early, encouraged by his mother. His first significant job was at the art dealers Goupil & Cie in The Hague, secured by his uncle Cent. This job eventually led him to London, where he experienced a brief period of happiness and success.\n"
